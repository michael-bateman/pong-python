# Pong
## About
I made this in my Grade 9 CompSci class for our Python Pong Test.  We were required to make 3 changes from the original program.

### Changes
* Change the start key from "g" to "s"
* Make the program change to a random background colour when the ball hits a wall
* Add scoreboard to add score when the ball hits the paddle

## Requirements
To run this properly, you will need to install the [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org) module on your computer.  Follow [these instructions](http://kidscancode.org/blog/2015/09/pygame_install/) to install the module.

For more information, please open the `document.pdf` PDF.  At the end of the test, only the `document.pdf` get's submitted.
